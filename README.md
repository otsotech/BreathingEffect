# BreathingEffect
To use this script, attach it to the camera game object in your Unity scene and adjust the values of breathCycleDuration, maxMovementAmplitude, and maxRotationAmplitude to control the breathing effect. You can also adjust the movementRandomValue and rotationRandomValue variables to randomize the effect even further.
